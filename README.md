# Learning material for Scala

This is a little repository created for the talk "From PHP to Scala: My experience" held in 2024 during the Scala Matsuri in Tokyo.

* <b>[Rock the JVM](https://rockthejvm.com/):</b> One of the best resources you can find honestly. He has a YouTube channel where you can find free courses on Scala and even if free the quality is very high, with these free courses you can understand a lot of how Scala works. But the paid courses are the best part!! Rock the JVM published during the time a lot of different courses. It offers Scala basic and advanced courses and also very specific courses for libraries and frameworks such as Cats, Akka, ZIO etc...
* <b>[Scala Book](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/introduction.html):</b> The Scala book is basically a really quick introduction to the magical world of Scala. The book consists of more than 50 lessons. In my opinion one of the mandatory stuff you need to read if you want to start working with Scala.
* <b>[Tour of Scala](https://tourofscala.com/):</b> This is a funny way to learn Scala. This website offers some exercises designed to be solved in a short amount of time with the goal of teaching you a little bit each day.
* <b>Coursera</b>: This platform is famous as it offers a lot of high-quality training material. Coursera offers a lot of really good stuff also for Scala, just search "Scala" in the website search bar. I tend to always recommend [this course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala) which is held by Martin Odersky in person (one of the Scala's creators :D)
* <b>[This week in Scala](https://petr-zapletal.medium.com/): </b> A really amazing newsletter that helps Scala developers to be updated with the latest news in the Scala's world. In each newsletter You'll find a lot of different "categories" of useful information. For example, you'll find some titles like the following: "Events", "Releases" and "Learning materials".
[Here](https://petr-zapletal.medium.com/this-week-in-scala-mar-11-2024-a9e3192790c2) an example of how one of this newsletters looks like
* <b>[Scala times](https://scalatimes.com/):</b> Another amazing weekly newsletter to be updated on what's happening in the Scala ecosystem.
* <b>[Scala matters](https://www.scalamatters.io/):</b> Like the description on the website says: it's kind of a vault where they have stored a lot of meetups videos and blogs.
* <b>[Scala news](https://www.scalanews.net/):</b> Another great resource with a curated list of Scala-related news from the whole community.
